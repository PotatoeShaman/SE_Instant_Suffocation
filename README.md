A simple mod for the game Space Engineers that allows for configurable damage when a character is exposed to the vacuum of space.

Increases damage taken in vacuum to 50 by default for vanilla astronauts (Now configurable!). You have about 2 seconds to live if you open your helmet.

All character **DamageAmountAtZeroPressure** values are now individually configurable through the Admin TextHudAPI ModSettings menu *[Alt+F10. Top Left]*. Meaning you can <sub>***hopefully***</sub> change the damage of modded/vanilla NPCs and suits individually. The effect should take place immediately (no reload required).

**I haven't tested the configurable values in multiplayer or dedicated servers yet, *but the default 50 damage should still work.***

I recommend using this with the [Helmet Malfunction](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1369595487&searchtext=helmet+malfunction) mod for a great challenge in space.
